Above image is the preview of Pong Game that we have made for the final project of First Semester. Two players can play at a time and they have to protect the ball from hitting their corresponding border. It the ball hit the back border, and then one team will score a point. For example, if the ball hit the left border i.e. the border behind the red bat, then the blue player will be able to score a point. And each of them has three chances which mean that the player who is able to score 3 point at first, he/she will be the winner of the game.
